This is a simple yet well-structured web-based calculator built using Flask. It follows a clean separation of concerns: the core logic is encapsulated in a Calculator model, while the Flask app handles routing and user interaction. The interface is rendered with HTML and styled using embedded CSS for clarity and usability.
Users can input two numbers and choose an operation — addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. The form submits via POST, and the backend processes the inputs using the model’s .compute() method. It handles invalid inputs and division-by-zero gracefully, returning clear error messages.
The app runs locally at http://127.0.0.1:5000/, but it’s lightweight and ready for deployment to platforms like Azure App Service or Render. It’s ideal for learning Flask basics, demonstrating MVC principles, or serving as a foundation for more advanced tools like scientific calculators or educational platforms.
